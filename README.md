ðŸ›³ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning.
The dataset comes from the Kaggle Titanic competition, a classic beginner-friendly challenge for data science and ML enthusiasts.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature encoding, normalization.

Models used: Logistic Regression (baseline) and XGBoost (tuned).

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix.

Final model achieves ~82% accuracy on validation set.
